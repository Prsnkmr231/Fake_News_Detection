# Fake_News_Kaggle

   Repository contains the source code for detecting the Fake News Using the LSTM RNN

##STEPS:

1.Importing the necessary libraries.

2.Reading the Dataframe and Drop the null values.

3.Implementing the stemmming and lemmatization on the words.

4.Converting sentences in onehot representaion and padding the sequences.

5.Building the Sequential Model with Lstm  and Dense Layer.

6.Training the model with the data for 15 epochs

7.Testing the model on the test dataset and generating the submission.csv file.
